      "Question: How can design features be used to prevent harm?\n",
      "Answer: Design features can be used to prevent harm by implementing interventions such as right-sizing content visibility, giving users access to more powerful features as they engage more deeply, broadening a user's information diet through deliberate mechanisms of alternative exposure, and giving users capability controls over a circumscribed perimeter. By changing the design of features, platforms can be made less capable of being abused and can mitigate the impact of digital harms. Legislative action that constrains the set of features that platforms can offer is also likely to be effective in preventing harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the core idea behind the project of the Integrity Institute?\n",
      "Answer: The core idea behind the project of the Integrity Institute is to prevent digital harms through platform design. It aims to illustrate the connections between feature design choices and harms, and catalog proposed changes (interventions) to reduce harm through voluntary action or legislation. The project is a wiki that can be edited and improved by anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the drawbacks of relying on content moderation to address abuse on platforms?\n",
      "Answer: The drawbacks of relying on content moderation to address abuse on platforms include the high cost and contentious nature of reacting to user content or behavior after harm has already been done. Additionally, reporting functions can become overwhelmed when platforms are inundated with novel forms or strategies of abuse. Content moderation may also fail to address issues that are not obvious to the user, such as malware or hate speech that occurs out of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are some examples of harmful activities that can occur on a common platform?\n",
      "Answer: Some examples of harmful activities that can occur on a common platform include spam, phishing, malware, harassment/cyberbullying, scams, multi-level marketing, self-harm amplification, non-consensual explicit imagery, doxxing, blackmail, election misinformation, health misinformation, violent extremism, child sexual abuse imagery, and impersonation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What measures can be taken by educational institutions to prevent the dissemination of child sexual abuse imagery?\n",
      "Answer: Educational institutions can take measures to prevent the dissemination of child sexual abuse imagery by implementing features such as right-sizing content visibility, requiring users to create accounts before using certain features, and recording extensive metadata about sensitive activity. These measures can help restrict the reach of harmful content, increase accountability, and provide valuable information for law enforcement purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the definition of Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAM)?\n",
      "Answer: Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAM) is the creation and distribution of images, audio, or video that depicts the sexual abuse of children. It is a form of online harm that is illegal and constitutes a serious criminal and moral violation. CSAM is universally condemned and there are laws, collaboration, and tools in place to combat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the notable area of broad consensus on the internet?\n",
      "Answer: The notable area of broad consensus on the internet is the decentralization of authority that yields collective wisdom at scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is one feature that can facilitate Child Sexual Abuse Imagery?\n",
      "Answer: One feature that can facilitate Child Sexual Abuse Imagery is allowing anonymous uploads of images or videos, as it risks illegal material being uploaded and shared without accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is one limitation of the current system?\n",
      "Answer: One limitation of the current system is that it requires users to create an account before they can use features that create data or interact with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of the FoF intervention?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of the FoF intervention is to implement reporting mechanisms, author comment-moderation, identity verification, request to follow, and read before re-share features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of the File/Link Sharing Search design change?\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of the File/Link Sharing Search design change is to address the risks and harms associated with file and link sharing, such as copyright infringement, resource abuse, malware, ransomware, manipulated media, child sexual abuse imagery, and non-consensual explicit imagery. The design change aims to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety and integrity of the platform and its users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How can knowing the original poster of content help in cases like Child Sexual Abuse Material and Election Misinformation?\n",
      "Answer: Knowing the original poster of content can help in cases like Child Sexual Abuse Material and Election Misinformation by allowing authorities to track the content back to its source, which can lead to the rescue of children from sexual abuse and the prosecution of those spreading misinformation. Platforms can facilitate this by retaining records of the chain of custody and creating tools to find the first post of a piece of media. This helps users discern between truth and fiction and enables authorities to assign blame for illegal content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why is retaining records along the line of a 'chain of custody' important in situations where content is shared, posted, or sent?\n",
      "Answer: Retaining records along the line of a 'chain of custody' is important in situations where content is shared, posted, or sent because it helps track the origin of the content and the original author. This is crucial in cases where re-shares, screenshots, and other forms of reposting can obscure the original source of the content. It also enables authorities to assign blame for illegal content and helps users discern between truth and fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the main features of the Focus on Features document?\n",
      "Answer: I'm sorry, but based on the given context, I don't have enough information to answer the question about the main features of the Focus on Features document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Where are the public components of this site hosted?\n",
      "Answer: The public components of this site are hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Storage and Github Pages.\n",
